<h1> The RAVEN </h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The poem of the Raven itself is a artwork of a greiving Poe. The Raven itself symbolizes the messenger of death by telling Poe that his beloved Lenore has died, and is to be seen Nevermore (as the raven quotes). The poem leaves him with deep and great sorrow knowing his true love is gone forever. It is sure to leaves chills up a person spine, especially how the relatability that can be brought in it.  <br></p>
    
    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <br> <p> Poe describes the raven as the messenger of death, by stating it's from "Night's Plutonian Shore" otherwise known as the Underworld. The raven's constant repetition of the word "Nevermore" reminds the speaker of Lenore's passing, and that he will never see her again in this life, or the next and the impoossibility of ever forgetting her. The Bust Of Pallas. "Pallas" referds to the Greek goddess of wisdom Pallas Athena. It is the Bust of Pallas that the raven is perched upon represents sanity, wisdom and scholarship. It shows that the ravens message threatens the speakers rationalality and its refusal to move demostrates how the speakders grief is immovable and increasingly blocking rational thought. The Chamber is the setting of the poem it shows that the speaker attempting to shut himslef away from his own grief. Even though he isn't successful at distracting himself from the thoughts of Lenore. It is not until he opens the door to check on the knocking that he actively himself to follow thoughts of her. In this way of description the raven entering his chamber symbolizes the way grief has entered and barged its way into the speakers life. It shows that even his solitary chamber cannot evade the madness that results from the death of his beloved.  <br></p>
